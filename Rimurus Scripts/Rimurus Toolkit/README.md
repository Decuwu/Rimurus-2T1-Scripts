<h1 align="center">Rimurus Toolkit</h1>

 Rimurus Toolkit was my very first script i released for [2Take1 Menu](https://gta.2take1.menu/). <br/>
 Which has some neat features like having the ability to spawn an object or ped from a list of every type in the game. But has since been ported into my newer script (Rimurus Menu)
 

<h1 align="center">Installation</h1>

Navigate to the [Releases Panel](https://github.com/Rimmuru/Rimurus-2T1-Scripts/releases/) and download the release titled Rimurus Toolkit<br/>
Then install it following 2take1's installation guide which can be found [here](https://gta.2take1.menu/features/local/scripts/)<br/><br/>
Make sure to not download the source. Doing so you risk downloading a version that can potentially cause unintended issues<br/>

This project has been discontinued and since has been merged into [Rimurus Menu](https://github.com/Rimmuru/Rimurus-2T1-Scripts/tree/main/Rimurus%20Scripts/Rimurus%20Menu)
